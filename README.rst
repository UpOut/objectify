Base object models for API objects.

Allows you to have objects which expand themselves e.g.
::
    {
        "name" : "Will",
        "object" : "12345"
    }

In this case we want to be able to expand "object" into the the actual object related to the value 12345, e.g.
::
    {
        "name" : "Will",
        "object" : {
            "id" : "12345",
            "key" : "value",
            ...
        }
    }

NOTE:
The datetime property REQUIRES both pytz and python-dateutil
